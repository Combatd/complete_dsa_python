# What is recursion?
* Recursion is a way of solving a problem by have a function call itself.
* Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
* In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
* A base condition is needed to stop the recrusion, otherwise an infinite loop will occur.
