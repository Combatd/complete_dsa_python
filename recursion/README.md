# What is recursion?
* Recursion is a way of solving a problem by have a function call itself.
* Performing the same operation multiple times with different inputs
* In every step we try smaller inputs to make the problem smaller
* A base condition is needed to stop the recrusion, otherwise an infinite loop will occur.

# Why do we need recursion?
* Recursive thinking is important in programming, and it helps you break down big problems into smaller ones, making it easier to use.
* Recursion is prominently used in data structures like trees and graphs.
* Interviews will have problems where recursion is optimal
* It is used in many algorithms (divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)

## When should you choose recursion?
* If you can divide the problem into similar subproblems
* Design an algorithm to compute nth.
* Write code to list the first n
* Implement a method to compute all
* To practice writing clean code.
