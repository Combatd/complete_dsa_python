# What are Data Structures?
* Data Structures are different ways of organizing data on your computer that can be used effectively.
* We understand we use data structures to make our programs very efficient, but there are many data structures to choose from.
* A professional software developer needs to know what data structure to choose for an application, because it has a direct effect on the performance.

# What is an algorithm?
* Set of steps to accomplish a task.
* Everyday in our daily lives, we use algorithms (sets of steps) to do things. To get a coffee, go to a coffee shop, pay money, and then grab the coffee.
* Input Data -> Calculation -> Stops when answer is found
* Compression Algorithms
* Dijkstra's Algorithm - shortest path
* Optimization and Scheduling Algorithms
* Criteria for good algorithms - correct and efficient

# Why are data structures and algorithms important?
* Take data as an input, process it, and give the processed data as an output
* Solutions to many problems in software development can be found on the internet, but how do you know which is the correct solution?
* Even with more powerful machines, bad code can still make a computer slow down or run out of memory.
* Algorithms show employers problem solving skills and programming fundamentals in a limited time frame.
