Complete Data Structures and Algorithms in Python

## Learning Goals
* Learn basic algorithmic techniques such as greedy algorithms, binary search, sorting and dynamic programming to solve programming challenges.

* Learn the strengths and weaknesses of a variety of data structures, so you can choose the best data structure for your data and applications

* Learn many of the algorithms commonly used to sort data, so your applications will perform efficiently when sorting large datasets

* Learn how to apply graph and string algorithms to solve real-world challenges: finding shortest paths on huge maps and assembling genomes from millions of pieces.
